This repository showcases the development of the Permaculture Club Management System, a dynamic full-stack web application designed for EcoScope Permaculture Club. The platform is designed to streamline the club's operations by automating the management of member details, bookings, lesson schedules, payments, and more.

## Agile Methodologies

I was primarily responsible for analyzing user requirements and writing back-end functions for user management, news and feedback sections, and instructor management.
